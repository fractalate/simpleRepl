=== simpleRepl ===
====== A repl module meant to be extended with custom commands. ======
The node builtin REPLserver.eval is read only now, 
so the solution in this issue doesn't work anymore. https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/29719

It's also really difficult to access the defaultEval function used for instaniation. This is the major reason I started this project.

Running subcommands are supported also, but `help` is not yet implemented on subcommands.

--- use ---
Check out example.ts for an example, or set up a very basic instance like:
```
import {simpleRepl} from './repl';
const repl = simpleRepl();
``` 

once you are in the repl environment try running `help`.
