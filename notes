=== simpleRepl ===
====== A repl module meant to be extended with custom commands. ======

REPLserver.eval is read only now, so the solution in this issue doesn't work anymore. https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/29719
It's also really difficult to access the defaultEval function used for instaniation. This is part of the reason we are doing this.

--- use ---
Check out example.ts for an example, or set up a very basic instance of like:
```
import {simpleRepl} from './repl';
const repl = simpleRepl();
``` 

once you are in the repl environment try running `help`.
